OpenDoor adds social relevance to your website by connecting the dots between visitors, their network of professionals and your content.

== Description ==

Personal connections influence and inform every level of consumer engagement, in fact...

**92% of consumers around the world** say they trust word-of-mouth, friends and family, above all other forms of brand communication (Nielsen)

**74% of consumers rely on social networks** to guide purchase decisions (Gartner).

**The problem:** Until OpenDoor there was not a single Wordpress plugin that automatically finds and surfaces the relevant connections between visitors and their relationships with brands, content and services.  

**The solution:** OpenDoor is a user friendly plugin that automatically connects the dots between content, visitors, and industry influencers via their social relationships to promote original content and add social relevance to articles. The platform also works across social networks, allowing a connection to be made from a Facebook relationship to a LinkedIn relationship etc, further extending your market reach.

OpenDoor uses patent-pending technology to connect relevant professional communities with your content.  

 * Expand your audience and market reach through active content marketing
 * Motivate professionals to share your articles through their social channels


**For example...** If you published an article about real estate in Austin; the plugin would automatically notify realtors in the Austin area about your article. 

**OpenDoor Plugin**, with this plugin you can:

 * Categorize existing articles by industry
 * Market content through industry media streams
 * Add the Social Beacon to your website
